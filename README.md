## For my project, I will analyze the `RawData.csv` data included in this repository. 

Download all the files in this repository to your current directory, including `MakeFile`, `RawData.csv`, `cleandata.R` `InstallPackages.R`, and `ReishusProjectRender.Rmd`. 
Exexcute the commands by entering `make` in the command line. This will generate `ReishusProjectRender.html` to show the results of the analysis.
